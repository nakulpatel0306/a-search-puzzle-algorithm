# A\* Puzzle Solver 🚀

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **A*** Puzzle Solver*\*, an intelligent and efficient way to solve classic sliding puzzles like the 8-Puzzle, 15-Puzzle, and 24-Puzzle using the A\* search algorithm. This project leverages powerful heuristic techniques to minimize the search space and solve puzzles optimally.

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Solves sliding puzzles (8, 15, and 24-Puzzle) using A*** Search*\*\
✅ **Three Heuristics for Optimal Performance:**

- 🔹 *Misplaced Tiles:* Counts misplaced tiles.
- 🔹 *Manhattan Distance:* Measures the total movement required.
- 🔹 *Linear Conflict:* Enhances Manhattan Distance with additional penalties for conflicting tiles.

✅ **Generates 100+ Unique Solvable Puzzles Automatically** \
✅ **Performance Analysis for Each Heuristic** 📊\
✅ **Python-based with clean, modular code**

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AStar-Puzzle-Solver.git
   cd AStar-Puzzle-Solver
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Solver

```bash
   python puzzle_solver.py
```

## 📊 Sample Output

```
🔢 Initial Puzzle State:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0

🏁 Goal state achieved in 6 steps!
🧠 Heuristic Comparisons:
   - Misplaced Tiles: Steps = 10, Nodes Expanded = 25
   - Manhattan Distance: Steps = 7, Nodes Expanded = 18
   - Linear Conflict: Steps = 6, Nodes Expanded = 15
```
